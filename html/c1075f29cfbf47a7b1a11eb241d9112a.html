<p align="justify">The experiment involves selection of a point on a road stretch and a starting time of experiment. Then select the duration of experiment (say 20, 30, 60 or 120 mts) and the count interval (5, 10, or 15 mts). The student may then start the simulation of traffic flow for the selected duration. Whenever a vehicle passes the selected cross section of the road, click on the corresponding cell of the observation table. Each row of the table represents each of the count intervals, and each column of the table indicates the class of the vehicle. At the end of the simulation, enter the row total (total vehicle in each count interval) and the column total (total count of each type of vehicle). The student then converts the total flow into the flow rate as below:</p>

<p align="justify">Where q is the flow rate in vehicle per hour, n<sub>T</sub> is the total vehicles is counted in a duration of T minutes. Next the students calculate the peak hour factor as below:</p>

<p align="justify">Where n<sub>t</sub> is the number of vehicles in i<sup>th</sup> count interval, t is the duration of each count interval, <img src="http://tel-iitb.vlabs.ac.in/exp4/images/img3.png" style="width: 57px; height: 43px;" />, T is the total duration of the experiment. The outputs of the experiment include (1) flow rate in vehicle per hour and the (2) peak hour factor.</p>
<br />
<p>The experiment will be demonstrated by running the experiment in the tutorial mode, and later once the student understands the computation, can do the experiment and submit the result. Once the result is submitted it will be evaluated based on the actual count generated by the system. Also note that, the student can run the simulation for one vehicle type each (This is similar to multiple people counting the vehicles).</p>
