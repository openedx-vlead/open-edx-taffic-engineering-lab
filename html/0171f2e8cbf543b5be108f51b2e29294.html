<p align="justify">The parking survey data collected from a parking lot by license plate method is as shown in the table 3 below. Find the average occupancy, average turnover, parking load, parking capacity and efficiency of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Columns 1 to 5 are the input data. The parking status in every bay is coded first. If a vehicle occupies that bay for that time interval, then it has a code 1. This is shown in columns 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the table corresponding to the time intervals 15, 30, 45 and 60 seconds.</p>
<br /><ol><ol>
<li>Turn over is computed as the number of vehicles present in that bay for that particular hour. For the first bay, it is counted as 3. Similarly, for the second bay, one vehicle is present throughout that hour and hence turnout is 1 itself. This is being tabulated in column 10 of the table. Average turn over = <br /> <img src="http://tel-iitb.vlabs.ac.in/exp7/images/img9.png" style="width: 256px; height: 42px; margin-left: 10%;" /> </li>
<li>Accumulation for a time interval is the total of number of vehicles in the bays 1 to 12 for that time interval. Accumulation for first time interval of 15 minutes = 1+1+1+1+1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1 = 10</li>
<li>Parking volume = Sum of the turn over in all the bays = 27 vehicles</li>
<li>Average duration is the average time for which the parking lot was used by the vehicles. It can be calculated as sum of the accumulation for each time interval x time interval divided by the parking <br /> <img src="http://tel-iitb.vlabs.ac.in/exp7/images/img10.png" style="width: 461px; height: 45px;" /> </li>
